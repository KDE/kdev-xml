This implementations is probably completely wrong.
It serves as a half baked/but half working idea and is not included in the build.
The source was copied and modified from TextDocument/PartDocument.

What is outstanding:
1) Actual functionality ie: being able to modify schema and XML through tree.
2) Breaks on some encodings
